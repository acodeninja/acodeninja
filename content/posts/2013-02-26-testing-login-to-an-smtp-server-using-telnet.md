So if you are having problems sending emails there is always one sure fire way
to establish if the problem is your connection or not. This can be done using
the telnet application, a command line tool that is included in most operating
systems.

To do this you will need to open the command prompt, on windows you can do this
by pressing the windows key and tapping the R button once. The dialog that pops
up just needs “cmd” input and the OK button pressing.

The commands should be entered as follows:

```shell script
$ telnet smtp.someserver.com 25
```

This will show the following on screen:

```shell script
Trying 212.159.8.107... Connected to smtp.someserver.com. 
Escape character is '^]'. 220 smtp01 smtp smtp.someserver.com
```

To which you should respond by typing:

```shell script
ehlo server
```

The ehlo command produces a list of capabilities and starts then exchange of
information between yourself and the SMTP server. Once this has been done you
need to tell the server you intend to give it a username and password. To tell
the server this you need to enter the following:

```shell script
auth login
```

The server will then respond with

```shell script
334 VXNlcm5hbWU6
```

This apparently random set of characters is actually a string encoded in base64
this actually says “username”. So as it is asking the question in base64 we have
to reply in the same encoding, to do this you will need to convert the username
into base64. There is a handy website for doing this here:
http://www.base64encode.org/

Once you enter the username the server will ask you for the password, again in
base64. Once you enter the encoded password you will get confirmation of success
or failure.

You can then go on to test sending an email but that is outside the scope of
this article.
