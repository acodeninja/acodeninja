It took ages to try, and find a guide that actually helps with installing Nginx
on a Debian system. Most either involve compiling from source or are incomplete
to the point of leaving you with a useless system.

So there are a number of steps to take to get Nginx up and running on a Debian
system, and I will cover my way here.

## Step 1 – sources.list

First step is to get the sources for Nginx and php5-fpm into your apt source
list. To do this you need to add the following lines to your 
`/etc/apt/sources.list` file.

```shell script
# NGinX Sources
deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ squeeze nginx deb-src
http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ squeeze nginx

# DotDeb Sources - php-fpm
deb http://dotdeb.mirror.somersettechsolutions.co.uk/ stable all deb-src
http://dotdeb.mirror.somersettechsolutions.co.uk/ stable all
```

Once you have done this the first impulse is to run aptitude update, don’t, it
will fail and complain at you that there are no valid keys for the Nginx or
dotdeb sources.

## Step 2 – apt keys

So the next step is to set up the crypto keys that allow the new apt packages to
be checked and trusted.

**Nginx**
With Nginx you need to download their signing key, to do this run the following
command:

```shell script
$ wget http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key
$ sudo apt-key add nginx_signing.key
```

Drop the sudo if you are running as root (shouldn’t be but just in case). This
will add the key to your apt keychain and allow for verification of the packages
you download.

**php5-fpm**
php-fpm is the same, run the following command to add the signing key for the
dotdeb repository.

```shell script
$ wget http://www.dotdeb.org/dotdeb.gpg
$ sudo apt-key add dotdeb.gpg
```

Once all this is done feel free to go ahead and run aptitude update

## Step 3 – aptitude install

So we have all the required apt repositories set up, now it's time to install a
server stack. So what you do next depends on what you are intending to run on
your server. I run Nginx primarily for WHMCS installations as it makes the most
out of the VPS boxes my clients used to run it. For a WHMCS installation you 
need a few components:

* An SQL server
* PHP-Curl (With SSL)
* GD2 Image library
* PHP-IMAP

So for this I would go ahead and run:

```shell script
$ sudo aptitude install \
  nginx mysql-server-5.5 mysql-client-5.5 php5-fpm \
  php5-curl php5-gd php5-mysql php5-imap
```

This will set up nginx with php5-fpm adding in the required modules, for a
stripped down set up that doesn't include any extras try:

```shell script
$ sudo aptitude install \
  nginx mysql-server-5.5 mysql-client-5.5 php5-fpm php5-mysql
```

You can even get rid of the mysql packages if you have no plans to run an sql
server.

## Step 4 – Configuration
The last stage in sorting out your Nginx install is the configuration files.
Check out my [post on configuring Nginx](/posts/2012-09-12-nginx-config-files/). 

## Conclusion
Nginx is a very efficient and fast web server that when coupled with php-fpm
provides a great platform for high traffic web applications. With this guide it
is now easy to install and get up and running with a basic configuration.
