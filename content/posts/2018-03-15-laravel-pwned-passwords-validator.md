## a bit about pwned passwords
So, a while ago the pwned passwords database was made available to the public.
It was a great idea, a collection of all the discrete passwords that had been
included in all the data breaches from [';--have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
Annoyingly to check this database with version 1 of the api you could only 
specify a username to see if that was included in a breach.

With the release of the pwned passwords list, we can now check individual
passwords to see if they were included in a breach. So why not check this list
when registering new users and maintain the integrity of your user accounts.
This idea isn't new, and I heard it on Risky Business [E488](https://risky.biz/RB488/).

## why a laravel package?
I thought hells yeah, great idea, but where is the easiest place I can make this
module work with the most impact for my own projects? [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

Almost every large scale project I have worked on, has been written using the 
laravel framework. So why not just add a validator to this great framework to 
allow developers to quickly drop in a check against this database.

## why should I send passwords to some random api?
Don't worry, this package won't do anything as stupid as this. First it will
make a SHA1 hash of the password, then send the first 5 characters to the api.
The response from the API will contain a full list of hashes that match the
prefix we sent. If the rest of the hash exists in the list, then the validation
fails, and the error is returned to the validator instance.

## including in your project
Using this validator is really easy, check out the [Github Repo](https://github.com/acodeninja/laravel-pwned-passwords-validator) 
or just use composer to install it

```shell script
$ composer require acodeninja/laravel-pwned-passwords-validator
```

Then use it either in your request classes

```php
/**  
 * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.  
 *  
 * @return array 
 */
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email', 
        'password' => 'required|pwned_password_strict',
    ];
}
```

Or your controllers (if you swing that way)

```php
$validator = Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email', 
    'password' => 'required|pwned_password_strict',
])->validate();
```
