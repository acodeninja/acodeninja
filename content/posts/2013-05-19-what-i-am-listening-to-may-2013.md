It has been a while since I last put anything up here so I thought just sticking
up a post with my latest listening experience might be the way to go. A while
ago Wil Wheaton stuck a Zoe Keating track on This is my Jam called Tetrishead,
fell in love with it while walking around the downs in Bristol (UK).

So today while at my day job I am listening to Zoe Keating’s Album “Into the
Trees”. Give it a go! There is something special about looping a cello to create
such a beautiful sound.

Hope people enjoy this as much as I have.
