Ever since moving to Nginx I have had the self satisfied smile of someone who 
knows his web applications are going to be snappy. That's not just down to good 
coding, but down to the quality of the server software employed.

One problem that I came across with Nginx was implementing features found in the
.htaccess files you would usually use to set per site and directory settings 
within PHP and Apache. No longer would these work out of the box, so a new tack 
was needed.

Nginx has a pretty good config file structure, easy to read, logical and above 
all nice to look at. A standard server without any PHP looks a little something 
like this:

```nginx
server { 	
    root /var/www/onmylemon.co.uk/www; 	
    index index.html;

    access_log  /var/www/onmylemon.co.uk/access.log;
    error_log  /var/www/onmylemon.co.uk/error.log;

    server_name onmylemon.co.uk www.onmylemon.co.uk;
}
```

How nice does that look? On Debian you just drop this into the 
`/etc/nginx/conf.d` directory (making sure to call it somthing.conf) and run 
sudo `/etc/init.d/nginx restart`. On Ubuntu it is even easier, just drop this 
into /etc/nginx/sites-available/onmylemon.co.uk, run `ngxensite` then 
`sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart`.

Try hammering it a little, I usually use loadimpact for this and you can run a 
few free tests every day against a URL of your choice.

Now you have this maybe lets try some PHP in there? You will need to get 
php5-fpm up and running but this isn’t too much of a challenge. A small 
alteration needs to be made to the configuration we used previously.

```nginx
server { 	
    root /var/www/onmylemon.co.uk/www; 	
    index index.html;

    access_log  /var/www/onmylemon.co.uk/access.log;
    error_log  /var/www/onmylemon.co.uk/error.log;

    server_name onmylemon.co.uk www.onmylemon.co.uk;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

The first thing I noticed was `fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;` at first it didn’t 
sink in, but then I realised this is one of Nginx more interesting features. 
This allows you to pass php execution off to other servers thus using the server 
with Nginx on it purely as a reverse proxy.

So this just covers some basic stuff with the configuration files, I’ll be 
putting up more information as I delve deeper.
