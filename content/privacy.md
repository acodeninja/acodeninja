I always look to limit any impact on your privacy for any visiting this website.

On this page I'll let you know what runs in your browser when you visit my 
site, and what it is needed for.

## Cookies

I do not currently set any 
[cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) when you 
visit my site.

## Local Storage

I make use of [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage)
to store page and site settings, if Javascript is enabled. These values are not 
accessible by other websites if your browser is working securely.

### Site Theme

The overall theme of the site can be toggled from day to night mode. This results
in a value stored under the key `theme-dark`. This value can be either `true` or
`false`.

### Tracking Token

I currently use google analytics to track visits to my website.

If you choose to allow me to store a tracking code I will use the local storage
key `tracker` to store a unique tracking code. If you decide not to allow this,
I will instead set the value of this key to `false`. Accepting the tracking code
will mean that your visit will be tracked using Google Analytics.

## Outbound links

All outbound links to other sites make use of both the 
[noreferrer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/noreferrer)
and [noopener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/noopener)
link types. This limits the amount of information the page you land on has 
about which website you came from.
