              I‚Äôve been working a lot with HashiCorp‚Äôs terraform recently. From learning how to set up a highly available container based infrastructure using AWS ECS , to setting up a CloudFront distribution for a static site hosted on S3 .
One problem I have had to solve a number of times, is uploading the contents of a directory recursively to an S3 bucket. With the help of a post from Andy Dote‚Äôs blog, I was able to get some files uploaded.

              There are several ways that you can throttle the rate at which requests to your web application are processed.
Rate limiting within your authentication mechanism is undoubtedly useful. However, the chances are that this requires several calls to database and cache. Database queries could become a costly operation when your application is running under load.
To provide an extra layer of filtering, Nginx is capable of limiting request rates using the ngx_http_limit_req_module module.

              Testing a Laravel application has a low barrier to entry compared to other PHP frameworks . What happens when you want to nuke the database between tests? I thought I‚Äôd share a solution here.
feature testing One of the great features Laravel provides is the ability to refresh your database after each test. This has been really useful, but I needed to test verbs like DELETE and a simple php artisan migrate:fresh isn‚Äôt all that useful when you have seeds that add information to your database that your tests rely on.

              a bit about pwned passwords So, a while ago the pwned passwords database was made available to the public. It was a great idea, a collection of all the discrete passwords that had been included in all the data breaches from ‚Äô;‚Äìhave i been pwned? . Annoyingly to check this database with version 1 of the api you could only specify a username to see if that was included in a breach.

              Coming up with a great game idea was a lot harder than I initially thought, but then why did I think it would be easy anyway?
Enter Pugilica, a game I thought up while toying with some dice and card mechanics. The basic mechanic for the game would be players taking turns to roll the dice, the roll deciding how many cards they could play that turn to effect other players.
