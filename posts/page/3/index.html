Rate limiting within your authentication mechanism is undoubtedly useful. However, the chances are that this requires several calls to database and cache. Database queries could become a costly operation when your application is running under load.
To provide an extra layer of filtering, Nginx is capable of limiting request rates using the ngx_http_limit_req_module module.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2019-04-21-limit-api-requests-with-nginx/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2018-10-30-laravel-testing-database-refresh-with-seeding/>laravel testing: database reset with seeding</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2018-10-30</span>
