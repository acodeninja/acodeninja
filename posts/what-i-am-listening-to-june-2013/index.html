  <p>I think these posts might turn into a series! I was searching through
soundcloud the other day and came across TheBluesMobile.com a blues show on
soundcloud. The interview and bio/history of Hot Tuna brought me in, but then on
came The California Honeydrops a blues / gospel / new orleans jazz band. I am
now hooked and as soon as pay day comes around will be buying their new album
Like you mean it.</p>
<p>Anyways on to the music itself, let me know what you think to this glorious
album.</p>
