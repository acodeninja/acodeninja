  <p>When security fails it’s all good to point and laugh but sometimes it really
isn’t funny.</p>
<p>The MSD (Ministry of Social Development) in New Zealand set up a kiosk system to
assist with job seeking at local centres around the country. Unfortunately they
didn&rsquo;t heed the security report produced by Dimension Data and left open a
gaping hole into their enterprise network.</p>
<p>This hole was accessible by one of the oldest tricks in the book, Microsoft
Word’s File &gt; Open &gt; Browse Network. This allowed people to get access to such
gems as adoption papers, records of “at risk” children, plain-text passwords for
accessing internal systems and invoices of intra-department payments.</p>
<p>While security breaches are common place nowadays, to have this type of
ineptitude within a government agency is shocking to say the least. Especially
when the following seems to apply to all personal information in New Zealand:</p>
<p>“Section 6, Principle 5 of the Privacy Act 1993 states that the ministry must do
‘everything reasonably within the power of the agency’ to prevent unauthorised
use of the private information they hold.”</p>
